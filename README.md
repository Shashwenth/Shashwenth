- Cloud Infrastructure and DevOps 🛠️

## 🔨 Projects & Open-Source
### [SurveyMaster](https://github.com/yourusername/SurveyMaster)
A full-stack application built with **Spring Boot** and **React.js** that allows users to create and share surveys. Features integration with **OpenAI API** for auto-generation of questions and answers. Currently working on enhancing the **UI** and improving the application’s **backend performance**.

### [Custom Pthread, Malloc, File System OS](https://github.com/yourusername/CustomPthread)
Developed a user-level library in **C** to replicate Unix functionalities like `pthread`, `malloc`, and file systems. Implemented memory management, process scheduling algorithms, and deadlock prevention strategies, achieving 90% efficiency in performance.

### [Other Repositories](https://github.com/yourusername)
Feel free to explore my repositories for more open-source projects, including my work on microservices, backend APIs, and containerization with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
